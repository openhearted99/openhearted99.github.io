Here are a few short summaries of my major projects. My CV is at the bottom.


# High-Redshift Galaxy Surveys

As an undergraduate, I worked extensively with Professor [Danilo Marchesini][danilo-link] to create multi-wavelength galaxy catalogs from space telescope data. My particular assignment involved debugging and updating our group's image processing scripts -- a pipeline which interfaced with Source Extractor and other softwares for galaxy detection and photometry. Professor Marchesini's collaborator [Ben Forrest][ben-link] would later follow up on our photometric products in a co-authored [paper published in ApJL][paper1]. He found the largest spectroscopically confirmed quiescent galaxy at z>3, check it out!


# AGN Evolution

My second project was the result of a summer REU at Princeton University. There I assisted associate professional specialist [Neven Caplar][neven-link] on AGN variability, with our study investigating a curious trend of systemic dimming of the brightest AGN between the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey. Our [paper][paper2], (also published in ApJL) theorizes that this effect is not due to survey irregularities but rather a model-confirming decrease in luminosity.

# Cosmological Simulation and Galaxy Evolution

Finally, in the summer of 2020, I worked remotly at Space Telescope Science Institute under astronomical data scientist [Greg Snyder][greg-link]. We studied the results of the IllustrisTNG project, particularly the teamâ€™s most recent public release, TNG300-1. Our science looked at the distant (z>3) galaxy merger rate in lightcone catalogs that we fabricated from TNG300-1 outputs. Leveraging a JupyterLab interface, we were able to create pair fraction plots out to a redshift of z=6, greatly expanding on a 2017 paper by Dr. Snyder. This laid a statistical groundwork for future JWST surveys examining close-pairs at high redshift. I summarized our research in a [AAS Research Note][rn1] published last year.

And that's everything I've worked on so far! If you're intreseted in collaborating or would like to reach out to talk, please feel free to email me at:
And, as promised, here's my [CV][cv].
