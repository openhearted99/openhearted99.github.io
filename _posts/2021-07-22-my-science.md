As an undergraduate, I worked extensively with Professor [Danilo Marchesini][danilo-link] to create multi-wavelength galaxy catalogs from space telescope data. My particular assignment involved debugging and updating our group's image processing scripts -- a pipeline which interfaced with Source Extractor and other softwares for galaxy detection and photometry. [Ben Forrest][ben-link], a collaborator of Professor Marchesini, would later follow up on our photometric products in a co-authored [paper published in ApJL][paper1]. He found the largest spectroscopically confirmed quiescent galaxy at z>3, check it out!


# AGN Evolution

The final investigation was published as a [paper in ApJL][paper2].

# Cosmological Simulation and Galaxy Evolution

The research was summarized in a [AAS Research Note][RN1].
