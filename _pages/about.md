Hey there, I'm Teddy! I'm a first year astronomy graduate student at the University of Wisconsin – Madison.

My work so far has fallen under the broad umbrella of "Extragalactic Astronomy" — particularly the intersection of distant galaxy surveys and cosmological simulation. For a more complete introduction to my science, teaching, and work philosophy (plus my CV), please check out [my research post][openhearted99.github.io/more-about-me-research].

Outside of academia, I avidly follow video game criticism and competitive Super Smash Bros. I'm also hoping to write about my pastimes here on this website.
