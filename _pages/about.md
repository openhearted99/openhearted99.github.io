Hey there, I'm Teddy! I'm a first year astronomy graduate student at the University of Wisconsin – Madison.

My work so far has fallen under the broad umbrella of "Extragalactic Astronomy" — particularly the intersection of distant galaxy surveys and cosmological simulation. For a more complete introduction to my science, teaching, and work philosophy (plus my CV), please check out [my research post][mrp].

Outside of academia, I avidly follow video game criticism and competitive Super Smash Bros. I'm hoping to write about my work and pastimes  here on this website!
